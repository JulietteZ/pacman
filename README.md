# Pacman
Machine learning in Pacman scenarios. Course project for CSE 511: Introduction to Artificial Intelligence

## Project 1: General search algorithms
### Goals
General search algorithms for the Pacman agent to find paths through the maze world, both to reach a particular location and to collect food efficiently.
* Depth-first search (DFS)
* Breadth-first search (BFS)
* A* search
* Greedy search

## Project 2: Adversarial search algorithms
### Goals
The classic version of Pacman with multi-agents, implemented with adversarial search algorithms.
* Minimax search (with alpha-beta pruing)
* Expectimax search

## Project 3: Reinforcement learning
### Goals
Let the Pacman agent to learn the optimal path from trials using reinforcement learning.
* Value iteration
* Q-learning
* Approximate Q-learning
